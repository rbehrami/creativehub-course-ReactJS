      We achieve our mission by committing to compassion first and:
    </h6>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      Inviting you to be yourself because you deserve to be seen, heard, and respected. Each person (no matter their gender, age, or background) is on their own path. We honor this and invite you to join our collective journey of self-discovery through a personalized approach to daily rituals.
    </p>
    <p className='mb-4'>
      Providing a thoughtful selection of high quality + accessible products that bring joy to your daily rituals. Having an impactful self-nourishment experience shouldn't be cost prohibitive nor overwhelming, so we've created products that are results-driven, vegan, clean, eco-conscious, inclusive, and thoughtfully made to be considerate of different needs while helping YOU feel like your best self.

      Showcasing ancient holistic practices authentically â€“ the products we create integrate various transformative practices and tools our founder Lin grew up with and incorporates in her daily life: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Reiki, Crystals, Aromatherapy, and Astrology. Lin wanted to create a brand that makes this life-changing ancient wisdom that has significantly improved her life to be more approachable and inclusive, while preserving the legacy of her ancestors.
