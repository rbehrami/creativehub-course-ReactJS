//Variables in Javascript
//Assignments
// 1. Create a simple profile using variables to store a personâ€™s name, age, job, and a fun fact. Print the profile information to the console. Consider which variables will change over time and which will stay the same.

//Variable to store profile information
const fullName = "Rasim Behrami"; // it const because will not change later
let age = 40; // The variable age is declared with let because it can be changed later.
let job = "Front End Developer"; // The variable job is declared with let because it can be changed later.
const funFact = "I am faster than Usain Bold."; // The variable funFact is declared with const because we are not going to change this later.

console.log("My Profile");
console.log("My name: ", fullName);
console.log("My age: ", age);
console.log("My job: ", job);
console.log("My fun fact: ", funFact);
